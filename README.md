OWL Viewer

Present a simple listing of the classes and properties an OWL ontology, specification-style.

Inspired by [LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode), the goals of owlview are:
 * Simple (X)HTML 5 results that can be saved and included elsewhere
   * TODO: Indentation?
 * Predictable and [Cool URIs](http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/)

The project is still at an early, experimental stage.

## TODO

 * Menu overlay of Table of Content
 * Better navigation of large ontologies like [schema.org](http://owl.s11.no/view/ont/http://topbraid.org/schema/schema.ttl)
 * Alternative view with page per property
 * Nicer rendering of annotations
   * Markdown (optional)
 * Ontology metadata
 * Options - read from OWL?
 * Content-negotation and download button for different formats (RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD, etc)
 
## Live example
